AI specialist in LLMs, recommender systems, quantitative risk models and generative AI. Led large-scale AI transformation at Schibsted and created algorithms driving major user engagement in media and marketplaces.

I am interested in the feedback loop of AI systems from fundamental level and how we can learn from it. During my career I have always worked in the intersection of academia and industry on large scale AI systems in media, finance and marketplaces.
